//! Portable embedding-host boundary for the standard Responses state machine.
//!
//! This module contains no browser, Node, or `wasm-bindgen` types. An embedding
//! implements [`HostTransport`](crate::transport::host::HostTransport) and
//! [`HostConnection`](crate::transport::host::HostConnection), then installs
//! that transport with `OpenAiBuilder::host_transport` on WebAssembly. The
//! standard client continues to own request encoding, retries, continuation
//! state, streamed event decoding, and Tower semantics.
