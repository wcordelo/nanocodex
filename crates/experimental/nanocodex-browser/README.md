# Nanocodex Browser

Deterministic browser automation exposed as a normal Nanocodex Code Mode tool,
with an optional isolated headed-browser VM lifecycle.

`nanocodex-browser` is an experimental, unpublished, library-first crate. It
owns the browser action protocol, Chromium DevTools controller, diagnostics,
artifacts, and ordinary `BrowserTool`. Its named `vm` module composes those
browser concerns with `nanocodex-vm`; it does not own a second VM runtime.

The primary consumer is a Nanocodex agent. `BrowserTool` is caller-owned and is
not installed by default:

```rust,ignore
use nanocodex::{Nanocodex, OpenAi, Tools};
use nanocodex_browser::BrowserTool;

# async fn run() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let browser = BrowserTool::new()?;
let tools = Tools::builder().provider(browser).build()?;
let openai = OpenAi::new(std::env::var("OPENAI_API_KEY")?)?;
let (agent, _events) = Nanocodex::builder(openai).tools(tools).build()?;

let result = agent
    .prompt("Open https://example.com, inspect it, and report the main heading.")
    .await?
    .result()
    .await?;
println!("{}", result.final_message());
# Ok(())
# }
```

The model reaches the tool as `await tools.browser(...)` inside Code Mode. Its
full contract is discoverable at runtime through `ALL_TOOLS`, but provider
registration keeps that contract out of the model-facing tool prefix. A
runnable version lives at `examples/browser_agent.rs`. Callers that deliberately
want the eager schema can register the same value with `.tool(browser)`.

For isolation, one non-cloneable VM owner keeps the disposable browser alive
and gives the agent a tool handle:

```no_run
use nanocodex_browser::{BrowserAction, vm::BrowserVm};

# async fn run() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let browser = BrowserVm::builder(
    ".cache/browser/rootfs.ext4",
    "target/debug/nanocodex",
    ".cache/bin/gvproxy",
)
.vmm_args(["vm-run-config", "--config"])
.spawn()
.await?;

browser
    .browser()
    .execute(BrowserAction::Open {
        url: "https://example.com/".to_owned(),
    })
    .await?;

let tool = browser.tool();
// Pass `tool` to `Tools::builder().provider(tool)`.
drop(tool);
browser.shutdown().await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

Every VM spawn reflinks an immutable ext4 template, runs Chromium as an
unprivileged guest user under Xvfb, and exposes CDP only through a random host
loopback port. The owner shuts down the DevTools controller, Chromium, gvproxy,
the VMM, and the disposable disk together. The image definition and guest init
script live in `image/`.

For trusted local development, `Browser` provides the same typed actions
without a VM:

```no_run
use nanocodex_browser::{Browser, BrowserAction};

# async fn run() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let browser = Browser::new()?;
browser
    .execute(BrowserAction::Open {
        url: "https://example.com/".to_owned(),
    })
    .await?;
browser.close().await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

The browser starts lazily on its first local action. Use `Browser::builder()`
for deterministic browser context, egress policy, storage state, diagnostics,
or an explicitly managed CDP endpoint.

## Capabilities

- Chromium navigation and interaction through semantic references, CSS, roles,
  text, labels, frames, tabs, and open shadow roots.
- Bounded snapshots, DOM/layout/style inspection, console and source-mapped
  errors, network bodies, WebSocket messages, HAR, and React diagnostics.
- Screenshots, PDF, visual/session/performance traces, video, CPU profiles,
  coverage, heap inspection, accessibility/axe, Lighthouse, and CrUX actions.
- Harness-owned cookies/storage, virtual passkeys, allowlisted Brave handoff,
  upload roots, browser egress policy, remote CDP, and libkrun VM composition.

## Current boundaries

- This package is unpublished and its API is not stable. It currently targets
  native Unix hosts and Chromium's DevTools protocol; it is not a Firefox,
  Safari, WebDriver, WASM, Node, or Python browser adapter.
- Local mode is a private browser profile, not an OS sandbox. VM mode requires a
  prepared ext4 image, VMM entry point, gvproxy, and libkrun firmware. Its
  default network lease permits internet access; callers must supply their
  egress lease and browser policy when stronger restrictions are required.
- All browser actions remain available together. Their roughly 67 KiB contract
  is runtime-only with provider registration, so enabling browser adds no model
  warmup schema bytes. The contract is not capability-filtered after discovery.
- Lighthouse, CrUX, and video require caller-supplied external tooling or
  credentials. Brave profile transfer is harness-only and intentionally absent
  from the model-callable schema.
- Cloned browser handles share one session and serialized action stream. Call
  `Browser::close` or `BrowserVm::shutdown` when deterministic cleanup matters.
- The crate consumes `nanocodex-vm` unconditionally today, so local-only builds
  still pay the VM dependency's compile/link cost.
