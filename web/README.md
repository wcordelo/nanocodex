# nanocodex

A from-scratch Codex rewrite for the latest generation of models. The experiment is to keep the
same tools and behavior while making the runtime much smaller; nanocodex makes the implementation
and evaluation record legible.

## Stack

- Vite + React
- Cloudflare Vite plugin and Workers runtime
- Wrangler for preview and deployment
- just-bash over the thread's OPFS filesystem, with browser `git` and `gh` compatibility commands
- Pierre Trees and Diffs for the file tree, source viewer, and the single virtualized commit stream
- TanStack Virtual for the commit quick-jump and evaluation indexes
- Derived job, trial, trajectory, and verifier views

The visual system follows the local Paradigm website's semantic tokens,
typography roles, grid, controls, and search treatment while using system font
fallbacks rather than the site's proprietary font files.

## Development

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

The homepage consumes the publishable `nanocodex` and `nanocodex-react`
packages under `../js`; it does not reach into generated WASM artifacts. Its
React integration follows an external-store pattern: create a
`createConfig()` once, pass it to `NanocodexProvider`, and consume
`useNanocodex`, `useNanocodexMessage`, or `useConfig`. React owns no agent
history, credential policy, or model-loop state.

The local Worker and Vite client run together at `https://localhost:5173`, using
the same Cloudflare Vite-plugin layout as Tempo's React MPP examples.

### Documentation

The product guide lives in `docs/src/pages` and uses Vocs with full-static
rendering under `/docs`. Run `npm run docs:dev` while writing, or `npm run
docs:build` to generate the site, install it into `dist/client/docs`, and check
every route plus `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`. The normal `npm run build`
composes the Vite application and Vocs output into the one Cloudflare asset
tree; the docs are not a second service or runtime.

In development, Vite reads repository metadata from Git, serves working-tree
files on demand, and streams history directly from Git only when the commit
view opens. Startup does not generate or rewrite repository blobs. Set
`NANOCODEX_REPO` to point the development view at another checkout.

`npm run build` does not inspect Git or generate repository assets. Production
repository data is published separately to R2 by `npm run
publish:repository`. The publisher derives one coherent generation from a Git
commit, uploads only previously unseen source blobs and commit patches, uploads
one complete clone pack for exactly the advertised refs, and stores new Git
objects once in bounded immutable pack-entry shards. The Worker streams the
complete pack for a fresh clone, but uses the object graph and reusable shards
to send only the closure missing from an incremental or shallow fetch. Shards
are compacted after a bounded number of generations. Publication advances one
Durable Object pointer only after every referenced R2 object exists, so a failed
or concurrent publisher cannot expose mixed tree, history, or Git data. The
commit view loads only the selected patch and parses it in bounded batches,
yielding between batches so scrolling stays responsive.

For this single-repository deployment, R2 owns immutable bytes and one Durable
Object owns the current generation with compare-and-swap publication. D1 is
deliberately absent: there is no repository registry, account model, search
index, or relational query to justify it. Publishing requires the same
`GIT_MIRROR_TOKEN` secret on the Worker and `NANOCODEX_GIT_TOKEN` in the
publisher environment. The publisher also requires `/api/health` to attest the
same complete Git SHA before it makes an authenticated request or uploads an
object:

```bash
NANOCODEX_GIT_ORIGIN=https://nanocodex.me-7fb.workers.dev \
NANOCODEX_GIT_TOKEN=... \
npm run publish:repository
```

If the Durable Object contains an obsolete publication shape, the publisher
stops before uploading anything. Repair it atomically after deploying the
current Worker by explicitly opting into a current-format replacement:

```bash
NANOCODEX_GIT_ORIGIN=https://nanocodex.me-7fb.workers.dev \
NANOCODEX_GIT_TOKEN=... \
NANOCODEX_REPAIR_INVALID_PUBLICATION=1 \
npm run publish:repository
```

The replacement is accepted only while the stored publication is invalid; it
cannot overwrite a valid generation or bypass its compare-and-swap head.

Production serves the website indexes, immutable file and patch objects, and a
read-only Git protocol-v2 endpoint from that publication. Clone the mirror with
`git clone https://nanocodex.me-7fb.workers.dev/git`. GitHub remains the write
remote. After each current `master` commit passes CI, the website job deploys
the exact tested Worker with that SHA, waits for `/api/health` to return it as
`deployment_sha`, publishes the repository generation, and verifies both the
snapshot and Git protocol advertise the same SHA. An obsolete queued CI run is
not allowed to deploy or publish.

Each browser thread owns an OPFS working tree and an `origin` Cloudflare Git
remote on branch `nanocodex`. The Files and Commits surfaces read that thread's
actual Git objects in the browser; file blobs and commit patches are generated
on demand and released when the view refreshes. Push and pull notifications
cross the page/agent Worker boundary so an open repository view can preserve
its last complete render until the replacement snapshot is ready.

### Live eval view

`/evals` is part of the same production Vite and React application as the
Nanocodex homepage, embedded TUI, repository tree, and commit history. The
website reads its public API directly from the Cloudflare Worker. D1 owns the
task board and normalized result index; R2 owns task packages, case records,
and complete evidence. There is no coordinator host, tunnel, origin override,
or Access credential in the website read path.

Native benchmark hosts are disposable compute clients. They claim R2-backed
tasks from the Worker and authenticate every mutation with
`NANOCODEX_EVALS_WRITE_TOKEN`; they are never an authority for website reads.

The API is deliberately workset-oriented: the client loads the retained
workset index, drills into one workset's task summaries, loads one selected
treatment matrix, then requests a single opaque case ID for terminal evidence.
TanStack Query is the only application cache and owns polling, cancellation,
retry, and the overview/workset/task/case query lifetimes. There is no second eval-only HTML entry,
React root, Vite configuration, Node eval server, or browser-side SQL path.

The homepage is also a real embedded-agent demo with three deliberately thin
layers:

- `../js/bindings` publishes `nanocodex`, the viem-v3-style imperative client.
  Runtime entrypoints expose flattened `Agent.create` factories, decorated
  domain actions, standalone `Actions` namespaces, and typed watcher handles.
- `../js/react` publishes `nanocodex-react`, the wagmi-like headless React owner. Its provider and
  hooks manage the module Worker lifecycle, readiness, commands, and event
  subscriptions without imposing presentation policy.
- `nanocodex/tools` owns the framework-independent live React document,
  bounded workspace store, and typed artifact tool used by the web consumer.
- `AgentTerminal` is the optimized Ratatui-faithful consumer: native colors,
  rendering hierarchy, queue/steer behavior, `/btw`, historical branch editing,
  branch navigation, per-branch drafts, clipboard images, and key bindings over
  virtualized transcripts.

The module Worker loads the generated `nanocodex-wasm` package, and the Rust
engine owns the persistent Responses session, typed history, event stream, and
tool loop. Each thread opens one OPFS workspace shared by just-bash, Rust
`apply_patch`, isomorphic-git, the file viewer, commit history, uploads,
downloads, and the artifact dock. The model receives the standard
`exec_command` and Rust `apply_patch` tools rather than separate list/read/write
or Git tools. Shell commands include normal virtual Unix commands plus `git`
and `gh`; `git push origin nanocodex` publishes the same objects the
Commits view reads from the Cloudflare thread remote. Files survive agent,
Worker, and page restarts without being copied into conversation snapshots.
The Cloudflare Worker upgrades `/api/responses` and proxies OpenAI
tool calls. It accepts a user-provided OpenAI key into a one-hour Durable Object
session and returns only an opaque `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie. The key
is never placed in a URL, local storage, React state, or WASM configuration.

Custom interfaces use the typed `render_artifact` tool composed by
`nanocodex/tools/browser`, alongside `exec_command`, `web__run`, and
`image_gen__imagegen`. The tool accepts JavaScript source defining a real React
`App`; `React`, an `html` tagged-template helper, and `sendPrompt` are supplied by the isolated iframe
runtime. Published documents live under `.nanocodex/artifacts` in the same Git
working tree and open in a fullscreen dock. Reusing an artifact ID replaces the
interface in place, so voice or text turns can continuously retheme and extend
it. Generated code has no imports, network access, or access to the parent page;
explicit `sendPrompt` actions re-enter the normal queued prompt lifecycle.
A user key takes precedence over the optional deployment-owned
`OPENAI_API_KEY`; forgetting or expiring it falls back to that deployment key
when present.

The reusable `browser(...)` tool bundle gives the browser agent a bounded
`dataset` tool. It can inspect public
Parquet URLs, Hugging Face dataset/config/split exports, and uncompressed JSONL
URLs without downloading whole datasets into memory. Parquet reads use HTTP
ranges and filter/projection pushdown where possible; JSONL reads incrementally
scan the response stream. Dataset handles are scoped to an agent session. Query
limits and offsets accept any nonnegative safe range; input-byte and output-byte
budgets remain bounded. Partial results report `complete: false` and an opaque
`nextCursor` that retains projection and filters while resuming at the physical
Parquet row batch or JSONL byte position. The implementation and Parquet codecs
are lazy chunks, so ordinary agent sessions do not download them. Direct sources
must permit browser CORS. Parquet sources must honor byte-range requests; JSONL
sources must honor them when continuing from a cursor.

For example, ask the web agent to “inspect the `main` config’s `train` split of
`openai/gsm8k`, show its schema, and find five examples containing arithmetic.”
The resulting tool flow is equivalent to:

```json
{"operation":"open","source":{"kind":"huggingface","dataset":"openai/gsm8k","config":"main","split":"train"}}
{"operation":"query","dataset_id":"<returned id>","columns":["question","answer"],"filters":[{"column":"question","op":"contains","value":"how many"}],"limit":5}
{"operation":"query","dataset_id":"<returned id>","cursor":"<returned nextCursor>","limit":5}
{"operation":"close","dataset_id":"<returned id>"}
```

Run `npm run bench:dataset` in `js/bindings` for the deterministic 100,000-row
Snappy Parquet/JSONL browser-path benchmark. It reports cold and repeated query
latency, pulled bytes, range requests, scanned rows, and cache hits.

OpenAI remains the default agent connection. A user can explicitly select
Tempo MPP instead; only then does React lazy-load Wagmi and Tempo Accounts,
open the standard embedded Tempo Wallet dialog for its account and passkey flow, and
authorize a bounded one-day access key in that same Accounts connection
ceremony. The
module Worker hydrates that delegated signer from Accounts' IndexedDB storage
and gives it to an mppx session manager with a durable channel store. Marking
that manager as Nanocodex's Tempo provider also enables the package's built-in
Mercator MCP. MPPx pays its charge or session challenges with the same signer,
limits, and durable store; its tools remain deferred behind `tool_search` and
Code Mode. The model channel is reused across turns and reloads and is not
closed by Nanocodex. Wallet, payer, delegated signer, channel, model cumulative,
Mercator cumulative, and agent event JSONL are shown only while the MPP route
is selected. The normal OpenAI and ChatGPT routes do not initialize Mercator or
expose any payment state.

Development uses `vite-plugin-mkcert` because the Accounts SDK intentionally
falls back to a popup on plain HTTP. Cross-origin passkeys inside the hosted
Tempo Wallet iframe require a secure context; trusted local HTTPS exercises the
same embedded flow as production.

Local development reads the optional ignored root `.env` through the repository
workflow. For a shared demo fallback, configure the deployed Worker with
`wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY`. BYOK itself uses the `BYOK_SESSIONS`
Durable Object binding declared in `wrangler.jsonc` and does not require a
deployment-owned OpenAI key.

Streaming events are coalesced once per animation frame before updating the
semantic transcript, and each independently scrolling transcript is
virtualized. `npm test` keeps the
event accumulator bounded under a 20,000-delta burst and covers assistant,
reasoning, and tool lifecycle updates.

The homepage also exposes the release contract: the checksum-verifying install
command, in-place `nanocodex update`, the crates.io SDK entry point, and links
to the latest GitHub Release and grouped conventional-commit changelog. GitHub
release notes also credit each pull request contributor.

Navigation stays available whenever an input is not active: `H`, `T`, `C`, `R`,
and `E` switch between Home, Code, Commits, Requests, and Evals. The repository
homepage is the root route. In Code, `Ctrl+P` searches the left tree and `Ctrl+F` opens the
fuzzy all-file jumper. In Commits, `F` searches history. Code and commit
scrolling are left to Pierre CodeView and the browser's native input behavior.

## Production

`master` CI can own production deployment after the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
repository secret, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` repository variable, and
`CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOY_ENABLED=true` repository variable are configured. The
existing `NANOCODEX_GIT_TOKEN` publishes the matching repository generation.
Without that explicit enablement, CI still validates the complete production
graph but does not mutate the hosted Worker. Local commands build and preview
it:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

For a break-glass production deployment, start from a clean commit and preserve
the same attestation contract before running `publish:repository`:

```bash
revision=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy --strict \
  --tag "$revision" \
  --message "gakonst/nanocodex@$revision" \
  --var "DEPLOYMENT_SHA:$revision"
```

Do not publish repository data until the hosted `/api/health` reports that
exact `deployment_sha`. The publisher enforces this ordering independently. An
authenticated operator can publish the already-deployed master revision with:

```bash
gh workflow run mirror-cloudflare-git.yml --ref master -f revision="$revision"
```

For the one-time invalid-publication repair, add
`-f repair_invalid_publication=true` to that dispatch.

The proposal endpoint is intentionally a testnet-preview `402` until a live MPP
recipient and settlement policy are configured.
