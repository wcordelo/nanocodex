        r#"Drive the pre-materialized benchmark {selected} to completion at the highest productive host occupancy. You are the neural controller. SQLite is the only task authority, systemd is the only process authority, and every worker is one independent `{worker_command}` process.

Repeat this short control cycle until the board is terminal:

1. Observe, in one fresh compact Code Mode call, `{status_command}`; live or activating `nanocodex-eval-worker@*.service` user units with only their `Id`, `ActiveState`, `SubState`, and `ExecStart`; the `nanocodex-eval.slice` aggregate `MemoryCurrent`, `MemoryPeak`, `CPUUsageNSec`, and `TasksCurrent`; and the relevant lines from `/proc/meminfo`, `/proc/loadavg`, and `/proc/pressure/memory`. A unit belongs to this board only when its `ExecStart` has the `{worker_command}` shape for this selected profile; unrelated eval units affect host pressure but never this board's live count or reconciliation. Do not list inactive units, request unselected systemd properties, read journals or tracing during normal control, or keep a JavaScript loop, PID marker, worker pool, or other controller state. Only when a worker vanished unexpectedly may you read at most its last 20 warning-or-higher journal lines.
2. Reconcile before admission. {reconciliation}
3. Reason from the current and recent observations and choose an absolute desired live-worker count that maximizes terminal completions per hour. Starting units count as live. With backlog and no measured overload or throughput stall, grow aggressively in a batch; unused healthy capacity is a controller failure. OOMs and infrastructure retries are acceptable calibration signals. High utilization alone is not overload.
4. Let `live` be this board's live or activating unit count. Launch `min(unclaimed, max(0, desired - live))` workers immediately with unique lowercase systemd-safe names using `systemd-run --user --quiet --collect --service-type=exec --unit nanocodex-eval-worker@<name>.service --slice nanocodex-eval.slice --property OOMScoreAdjust=500 --property OOMPolicy=kill --working-directory "$PWD" --setenv "PATH=$PATH" {worker_command}`. The systemd unit, never this controller or a tool session, owns the worker lifetime. The kernel may kill a worker under genuine exhaustion; systemd must then clear that worker's entire cgroup so the next cycle can reconcile it.
5. With live workers and no elevated pressure or vanished worker, combine waiting and observation in one Code Mode call: start it with `// @exec: {{"yield_time_ms": 30000, "max_output_tokens": 2000}}`, await a 25-second `setTimeout` promise, and then collect the next compact observation. Never create a sleep subprocess, yielded background cell, or separate wait call. Let existing workers drain under overload; never stop, signal, or shed one manually.

Controller failure or restart must leave every worker untouched. On restart, derive the complete situation again from SQLite and systemd. Do not use subagents to own workers and do not wait for worker processes in Code Mode. Finish only when status has zero unclaimed and running rows and no live unit belonging to this board remains."#,
