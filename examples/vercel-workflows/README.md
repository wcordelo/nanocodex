# Nanocodex on Vercel Workflow actors

This example runs the Nanocodex Rust/WASM agent as a multi-turn actor built from
Vercel Workflows and native Vercel Function WebSockets.

Each Workflow run is one agent session:

- a typed Workflow hook accepts prompts and processes them sequentially;
- each Function step uses Nanocodex's built-in memory durability store and
  returns its opaque journal to the Workflow event log for the next step;
- every accepted prompt, typed agent event, and terminal result is appended to
  the Workflow's resumable stream;
- each WebSocket Function independently tails that durable stream, so clients
  connected to different Function instances still see the same ordered output;
- reconnecting with `startIndex` resumes after the last observed event instead
  of restarting inference.

This is the Vercel equivalent of the Cloudflare Durable Object and Rivet Actor
demos. It intentionally uses Vercel's actor-pattern Workflow rather than
pretending Function memory is durable. It does not require Redis.

## Architecture

```text
browser A ─ WebSocket Function ─┐
                               ├─ replayable Workflow stream
browser B ─ WebSocket Function ─┘             │
                                              ▼
                                  one Workflow run / actor
                                  sequential prompt hook
                                              │
                                              ▼
                                  Nanocodex WASM Function step
                                     ├─ Responses WebSocket → OpenAI
                                     └─ named persistent Vercel Sandbox
                                          └─ files, commands, preview domains

browser terminal ─ controller PTY WebSocket ─ same named Vercel Sandbox
                         (separate from the durable agent event stream)
```

The WebSocket connection itself is disposable and bounded by the Vercel
Function duration. The browser reconnects automatically. The Workflow run,
Rust journal, prompt hook, and output stream are the durable pieces. Vercel
persists the coarse Function-step result; within that step Rust/WASM still owns
deduplication, checkpoint reconstruction, and model/tool recovery policy.
A Function crash before the step returns therefore retries from the preceding
journal, not from an in-turn model or tool boundary. Deployments that need
mid-step crash recovery should back the same `DurabilityStore` interface with
an external atomic compare-and-append service instead of this in-step adapter.

Every Workflow actor also owns a named Vercel Sandbox. The caller-defined
`sandbox_exec`, `sandbox_start_process`, `sandbox_read_file`,
`sandbox_write_file`, `sandbox_list_files`, and `sandbox_preview` tools use its
isolated Firecracker VM. `/workspace` is a real alias for Vercel's persistent
`/vercel/sandbox` directory, including inside shell commands. Persistent
sandboxes automatically snapshot their filesystem when a VM session stops and
resume it on the next turn. Processes do not survive that stop/resume boundary,
so agents use `sandbox_start_process` to launch a detached process and wait for
its port before requesting a preview. The demo exposes ports 3000, 5173, 8000,
and 8080. Vercel OIDC authenticates Sandbox SDK calls inside the deployment, so
no Vercel access token is passed to Nanocodex or the guest VM.

The optional workspace terminal uses `@wterm/react` as the browser renderer and
`Sandbox.openInteractive()` as the PTY owner. The attach route resolves exactly
the same `nanocodex-<workflow-run-id>` Sandbox used by the agent tools, then
returns the SDK's short-lived controller WebSocket URL and token. Terminal stdin
is sent as binary UTF-8; the initial `start` and later `resize` controls are JSON
text frames. The PTY socket never carries Nanocodex events and the replayable
Workflow socket never carries terminal bytes.

These lifetimes are intentionally different:

- the Workflow actor and Rust journal retain committed conversation state;
- the named persistent Sandbox retains files across VM stop/resume;
- each terminal attachment owns one ephemeral login shell; reconnecting requests
  a fresh credential and starts a fresh shell; and
- detached preview processes survive a browser terminal disconnect while their
  VM remains running, but do not survive a Sandbox stop/resume boundary.

## Local development

Build the repository's WASM package and install this consumer:

```sh
just build-wasm
npm ci --prefix examples/vercel-workflows
```

For API-key authentication, use Vercel CLI's local runtime because native
WebSocket upgrades require Vercel's Function adapter:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export NANOCODEX_AUTH_MODE=api_key
export NANOCODEX_TERMINAL_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
npx vercel dev examples/vercel-workflows
```

For the same local ChatGPT subscription login used by Codex:

```sh
npm run dev:subscription --prefix examples/vercel-workflows
```

The helper reads `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` or `~/.codex/auth.json`, verifies that
the file is private and that the access token is not about to expire, and keeps
the token in the server process. `NANOCODEX_CODEX_AUTH_FILE` overrides the path.

`NANOCODEX_TERMINAL_TOKEN` is optional for the agent demo but required to attach
the workspace terminal. If it is absent, the terminal route fails closed with
HTTP 503. Enter the configured value in the browser only when attaching; the UI
keeps it in React memory and does not put it in localStorage, sessionStorage, a
URL, or the Workflow stream.

## Deploy with subscription authentication

Authenticate Vercel CLI once with `npx vercel login`, then run from the
repository root:

```sh
export NANOCODEX_TERMINAL_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
npm run deploy:subscription --prefix examples/vercel-workflows
```

The deployment helper:

1. links or creates `nanocodex-vercel-workflows` (override with
   `VERCEL_PROJECT`; set `VERCEL_SCOPE` when your account belongs to multiple
   teams);
2. copies only the current Codex access token and account metadata into
   sensitive Production environment variables, plus
   `NANOCODEX_TERMINAL_TOKEN` when it is present in the deploy command's
   environment;
3. enables Fluid Compute and sequential Workflow replay;
4. builds and packs the current repository's Nanocodex WASM package into a
   temporary deployment directory; and
5. deploys that staged app to Production without committing generated WASM or
credentials.

Fluid Compute applies to the Next.js Functions that host WebSocket tails and
Workflow steps. Vercel Sandbox is a separate persistent Firecracker service;
the example uses both rather than treating Fluid function memory as the code
workspace.

No refresh token is copied. When the access token expires or is rejected, run
`codex login` and deploy again. To restrict creation of new sessions, set a
random `NANOCODEX_ADMIN_TOKEN` before deploying; the browser never persists
that creation token.

After deployment, prove cross-client synchronization:

```sh
export NANOCODEX_DEMO_URL=https://your-project.vercel.app
npm run multiclient --prefix examples/vercel-workflows
```

The smoke test creates one Workflow actor, connects two independent WebSockets,
and submits one prompt. Both clients must observe the same acceptance, all five
successful sandbox tool results, model event stream, preview URL, and terminal
result. The test then fetches the public `vercel.run` preview itself and verifies
the unique file contents, proving that the hosted process—not a mocked tool or
the local machine—served the response.

## Browser demo

1. Create a new Workflow.
2. Copy its `wrun_...` session ID.
3. Open the deployment in a separate browser profile and join that ID.
4. Send a prompt from either client.
5. Detach or reload during inference; both clients resume the same durable
   stream and terminal result.
6. Ask it to use `sandbox_start_process` for a server on port 3000, then use
   `sandbox_preview`; open the returned `vercel.run` URL.
7. Enter the separately shared terminal token and attach. The shell starts in
   `/workspace`, the same filesystem the `sandbox_*` tools mutate. Detaching the
   terminal does not cancel an agent turn, and detaching the agent stream does
   not stop the shell.

The browser stores only the session capability, a bounded transcript, active
turn metadata, and its own stream cursor. Model credentials stay in the server
step. Treat the session ID as a bearer capability: anyone who knows it can read
that session's stream and submit prompts. If `NANOCODEX_ADMIN_TOKEN` is unset,
any visitor can also create sessions and consume model tokens.

Terminal access is deliberately stricter. `POST
/api/sessions/<session-id>/terminal` requires
`Authorization: Bearer <NANOCODEX_TERMINAL_TOKEN>` before it resolves or resumes
a Sandbox. The returned controller token grants an interactive shell and must
not be logged, persisted, placed in application URLs, or copied into Workflow
state. A production application should replace the demo's shared terminal token
with authenticated per-user authorization and verify that the caller owns the
requested Workflow session before issuing a PTY credential. Knowing only the
Workflow session ID is not sufficient for terminal access in this example.

## Validation

```sh
npm run check --prefix examples/vercel-workflows
```

The example pins the current native WebSocket API, which Vercel still labels
experimental. Connections are expected to close when a Function reaches its
maximum duration; automatic cursor-based reconnection is part of the demo's
normal lifecycle.
